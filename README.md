# Reveal.js Presentation

This is a sample presentation about Natural Language Processing (NLP), built with the [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) framework, using markdown for content and a custom theme.

## How it Works

- **Reveal.js is loaded via CDN.** No need to download or include the Reveal.js framework in this repository.
- The only files needed are `index.html` (the presentation) and `presentation.md` (the content in markdown).

## View the Presentation

- **Live URL:** [https://moutaouakkil.github.io/revealjs-presentation](https://moutaouakkil.github.io/revealjs-presentation)

## How to Run Locally

1. Install Node.js and npm:
   Download and install from https://nodejs.org/ (LTS version recommended)
   > Note: Installing Node.js from the official website will also install npm automatically.

2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/moutaouakkil/revealjs-presentation.git
   cd revealjs-presentation
   ```

3. Start the local web server:
   ```bash
   npx http-server
   ```
   Open the provided URL (usually http://127.0.0.1:8080) in a web browser.

## Editing The Presentation

- Edit `presentation.md` to change the slides. The HTML file will automatically load and render the markdown content.
